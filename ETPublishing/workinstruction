Work Instruction for QA: Running the Java Spring Boot Application
Overview
This document outlines the steps for QA to run the standalone Java Spring Boot application that processes XML files from ActiveMQ and uploads them to Azure Explorer.

Prerequisites
Java 21 installed on your machine.
Access to the internal repository where the JAR is uploaded.
ActiveMQ server must be running and accessible.
Azure credentials for accessing Azure Explorer.
Step-by-Step Instructions
Step 1: Download the JAR File
Access the Internal Repository:

Navigate to the repository location where the JAR is stored.
Download the JAR:

Locate the JAR file (e.g., your-app-name.jar) and download it to your local machine.
Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Configure Environment Variables:
Ensure the following variables are set:

ACTIVEMQ_URL - URL of the ActiveMQ server.
AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING - Azure connection string.
Example (Linux/Mac):

bash
Copy code
export ACTIVEMQ_URL="tcp://localhost:61616"
export AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING="<your-azure-connection-string>"
Example (Windows):

cmd
Copy code
set ACTIVEMQ_URL="tcp://localhost:61616"
set AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING="<your-azure-connection-string>"
Step 3: Run the Application
Open Terminal/Command Prompt.

Navigate to the Directory with the JAR:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/jar
Execute the JAR:

bash
Copy code
java -jar your-app-name.jar
Step 4: Verification
Check ActiveMQ:

Ensure the application is connected and processing messages from ActiveMQ.
Validate Azure Uploads:

Confirm that processed XML files are uploaded to Azure Explorer.
Review Logs:

Monitor the console output for any errors or processing messages.
Step 5: Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
Application won't start: Check environment variable configurations.
Connection issues: Verify ActiveMQ and Azure settings.
Step 6: Document Findings
Report any issues encountered during testing for further investigation.
Conclusion
You can successfully run the Java Spring Boot application using the provided JAR file. For assistance, contact the development team.
